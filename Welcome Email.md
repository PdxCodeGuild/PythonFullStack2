Hey everybody, and welcome to PDX Code Guild!

I'm ***{instructor}***, your instructor for the next ***{class length}*** weeks. I'm excited to get to know each one of you as we learn how to develop complex web applications in Python and JavaScript. Of course, we've got a lot of material to cover before we get there.

We'll be using three main apps for class: Zoom video meetings to hold classes themselves, Slack for chat, and GitHub for references, information, and assignments. You will receive another email with a Slack invite. Feel free to join up as soon as you get it and meet your classmates!

Please make an account on https://www.github.com if you don't already have one, and email me back with your GitHub username so I can add you to the class repository.

You will need to download the Zoom software on your computer before Monday. No need to create an account, you will use the following link to join when class starts:

***{zoom link}***

If Zoom asks you for a password, it's "***{password}***".

On ***{day of week}*** we will go over how to install Git, a command line, Visual Studio Code, and Python. In the meantime, I highly suggest reviewing the material and labs from the intro class. We will be hitting the ground running and learning new material, and we will spend very little time reviewing intro class material. If it has been a while since you took the intro class, make sure you put in some review so that you are ready to go next week.

Remember, class is M-F, ***{class times}***. I'm excited to get started, and I will see everyone on ***{day of week}***!

Thanks,
***{instructor}***
