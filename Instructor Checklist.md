# Instructor Checklist

## Scheduling

The day class is 14 weeks long, and the night class is 16 weeks long. This means that day classes have 70 sessions and night classes have 80 sessions. To facilitate holidays, instructor sick/personal days, flexibility, etc, classes are scheduled for one additional week. This means the day class has 15 weeks to fit in 70 sessions and the night class has 17 weeks to fit in 80 sessions. Our relationship with the VA means there are some strict rules we have to follow so that students recieve their full housing allowance and the Code Guild stays compliant with federal rules.

Classes need to end with their graduation date on the last day of the 15th/17th week of class. Classes cannot take no breaks and end early. It is up to instructors to schedule days off so that the class does not end early. Similarly, if an instructor needs to take extra sick/personal days, they need to find a substitute teacher so that the last day of class does not get pushed back. With this in mind, when using your five discretional days you have to cancel class during a cohort, don't use them all at once so that if an emergency happens and you have to add a couple more days, you don't go over.

During a bootcamp, class must be offered at least one day in any seven calendar days. Class can not be cancelled or scheduled off for planed dates such as holidays/weekends more than six contiguous days in a row. The VA does not allow us to take an entire week off during a bootcamp, and if this happens, veterans have to pay back that week's housing allowance.

## Teaching Tools, PDX Code Guild Style

### Slack

We use Slack for quick communication between students and staff. You will need to create a separate Slack channel for each class. This should be labelled with the course name and start end/dates in either the name or the description of the channel. This is what you'll use to share things with students, notify them of last minute changes of plans, chat with students to help them or answer questions, etc.

Keep in mind that Slack is ***ephemeral***. We're on the free Slack plan, so only about 2.5 weeks of past messages are accessible. Even if we were on a paid plan, Slack does not work well as a communications archive or a file sharing system. Anything you want to share with students as a reference should go on GitHub so it is easy to find later. Any docs you want as reference or to share with staff should be on Google Drive. Any communication with students/staff you want a written copy of should be sent via email. Slack is a chat system -- only use it as a chat system.

### Github

### Zoom

You will hold your actual class sessions using Zoom. This is the closest we can get to being "in person" without actually being in person. Here are some tips for Zoom:

- Put a password on your meeting for security.
- Avoid using in-meeting chat for important things. It's even more ephemeral and notifications/messages are easy to miss.
- As the meeting host, you can mute/unmute/kick out/etc people if trouble arises (or if someone just forgets to turn off their mic).
- Test your webcam and mic settings before you start the meeting, and give yourself extra time the first day.
- As a Zoom admin account and meeting host, you can change any settings to your liking. Remember there are a lot of customizations and available by logging in to [Zoom's website](https://zoom.us/profile).
- Use screen sharing for lectures. Unless there's something on your screen you absolutely need to have on the screen but not seen by students, it's best to share a whole desktop and minimize or move another desktop anything you don't want to broadcast. Sharing one app at a time is really clunky.
- You can also screen share a "whiteboard" that can be drawn on. This is great for using just like a real whiteboard. It works best if you have a touchscreen or an iPad you can run it on.
- The whiteboard-style drawing and annotation tools can be used to mark up a screen share live.
- There is a remote control option. I don't recommend using it. I don't want students controlling my computer, and I want students to always have to go through the motions of typing code and making changes themselves, even if following instructions.
- During worktime, use breakout rooms to meet with students individually as you would in a classroom setting. Only the host can edit breakout rooms, so you'll have to set themn up and put TAs/students in them. It's best to open several (4-6) breakout rooms at one time with manual assigning, that way you can add students to new breakout rooms as necessary. Breakout rooms are a bit of a clunky feature in Zoom at the moment and don't always seem to work intuitively, so plan on it being annoying until you've had some practice.
- Tell students to keep themselves muted by default unless they are talking.
- On the other hand, make sure students keep their cameras on, except during breaks. This is very important for several reasons: it counts as "in-person" attendance, it discourages students slacking and promotes a professional academic enviroment, it emulates the in person experience and provides familiarity for students, and it promotes class community, cohesiveness, and culture. Requiring cameras on is an important step to create a classroom enviroment that emulates "real life" as much as possible.
- You can schedule reoccuring meetings in Zoom with set start and end dates.

### Google Drive

Staff files and class records should be kept on Google Drive. This includes attendance and progress gradesheets.
