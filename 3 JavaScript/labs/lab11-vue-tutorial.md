# Lab 11: Vue.js Tutorial

Follow this [Vue.js tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LYrN_cAJoA&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQcYgjhBoeQH7wiAyZNrYa) up to lesson 16. For simplicity's sake, for this and the following Vue lab, you'll be working with the Vue cdn rather that Vue's command line interface. Vue-cli is more powerful and is recommended for larger scale applications. Feel free to continue the tutorial (where they go into vue-cli) but for the purposes of this course we will only go over basic Vue functionalities. 

The tutorial repository is located [here](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/vuejs-playlist/tree/lesson-1).
Each video has a corresponding branch. Try to follow along without looking ahead to the solution.
